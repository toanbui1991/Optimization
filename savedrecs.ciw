AB This study deals with industrial processes that produce soft drink bottles in different flavours and sizes, carried out in two synchronised production stages: liquid preparation and bottling. Four single-stage formulations are proposed to solve the synchronised two-stage lot sizing and scheduling problem in soft drink production synchronising the first stage's syrup lots in tanks with the second stage's soft drink lots on bottling lines. The first two formulations are variants of the General Lot Sizing and Scheduling Problem (GLSP) with sequence-dependent setup times and costs, while the other two are based on the Asymmetric Travelling Salesman Problem (ATSP) with different subtour elimination constraints. All models are computationally tested and compared to the original two-stage formulation introduced in Ferreira et al. (2009), using data based on a real-world bottling plant. The results show not only the superiority of the single-stage models if compared to the two-stage formulation, but also the much faster solution times of the ATSP-based models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
